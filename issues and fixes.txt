bugs:

wasd controls will probably be broken again

teleporting numbers (and camera) need tweaking (they were perfect, now they're not)

the colliders attached to the camera push enemies off cliffs (need to have an ignore statement for colliders in enemy layer for camera)

can't attack while running (easy fix probably)



fixes:

infinite sprint
infinite fall
not being able to move while holding down
clipping through ground when using weapon
camera not following on teleport out


added:
ability to jump through platforms in the 'backstage' layer
	can walk through bottom
	top is either small box collider or edge collider

stage layer is for pieces that the player cannot go through (in front of)

^(these layers are changed at the top, by tags)
