bugs  :

InputSettings  :
	wasd controls are probably broken again


Zelda.cs  /  PlatformControl.cs  :
	zelda doesn't stay on moving platform

Zelda.cs  :
	OnCollisionEnter2D  /  Invincible  usually removes 2 hearts instead of 1
	
	can't attack while running (easy fix probably)

	holding the attack button causes :  'Zelda' AnimationEvent has no function name specified!   error
	
	
Enemies get knocked over by zelda, need to change their physics settings so they don't move
	and / or make zelda get knocked back by them
	(increase mass in rigidbody maybe, (they might start pushing her though))
	
	


DONE (unless level is changed):
	base movement controls
		(will probably still need to add a couple if conditions)
		
	lost woods teleporting
	
	camera movement 
		(for level 1)
	
NEED :
	UI Menu for Game Over
	Level 2
	Background Music
	Death / Jumping Anim applied to Zelda.cs
	Death conditions for cliff / no hearts  (there is a heart counter in the Zelda.cs script)
	Cleaning Level 1
		remove unnecessary objects
		fix alignment of objects
		make sure all backstage objects are in correct layer
		make sure every other object that isnt foregroun/background is in stage layer
			(not enemies / UI)
		add background image ?
